Exercise - Route traffic through the NVA
========================================

Now that you've created the network virtual appliance (NVA) and virtual machines (VMs), you'll route the traffic through the NVA.

> **Note:** This exercise is optional. If you want to complete this exercise, you'll need to create an Azure subscription before you begin. If you don't have an Azure account or you don't want to create one at this time, you can read through the instructions so you understand the information that's being presented.

Create public and private virtual machines
------------------------------------------

The next steps deploy a VM into the public and private subnets.

1.  Open the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/) editor and create a file named **cloud-init.txt**.

    Bash

    ```
    code cloud-init.txt
    ```

2.  Add the following configuration information to the file. With this configuration, the `inetutils-traceroute` package is installed when you create a new VM. This package contains the `traceroute` utility that you'll use later in this exercise.

    Text

    ```
    #cloud-config
    package_upgrade: true
    packages:
       - inetutils-traceroute
    ```

3.  Press `Ctrl+S` to save the file, and then press `Ctrl+Q` to close the editor.

4.  In Cloud Shell, run the following command to create the **public** VM. Replace `<password>` with a suitable password for the **azureuser** account.

    Azure CLI

    ```
    az vm create\
        --resource-group "myResourceGroupName"\
        --name public\
        --vnet-name vnet\
        --subnet publicsubnet\
        --image Ubuntu2204\
        --admin-username azureuser\
        --no-wait\
        --custom-data cloud-init.txt\
        --admin-password <password>
    ```

5.  Run the following command to create the **private** VM. Replace `<password>` with a suitable password.

    Azure CLI

    ```
    az vm create\
        --resource-group "myResourceGroupName"\
        --name private\
        --vnet-name vnet\
        --subnet privatesubnet\
        --image Ubuntu2204\
        --admin-username azureuser\
        --no-wait\
        --custom-data cloud-init.txt\
        --admin-password <password>
    ```

6.  Run the following Linux `watch` command to check that the VMs are running. The `watch` command periodically runs the `az vm list` command so that you can monitor the progress of the VMs.

    Bash

    ```
    watch -d -n 5 "az vm list\
        --resource-group "myResourceGroupName"\
        --show-details\
        --query '[*].{Name:name, ProvisioningState:provisioningState, PowerState:powerState}'\
        --output table"
    ```

    A **ProvisioningState** value of "Succeeded" and a **PowerState** value of "VM running" indicate a successful deployment. When all three VMs are running, you're ready to move on. Press `Ctrl-C` to stop the command and continue with the exercise.

7.  Run the following command to save the public IP address of the **public** VM to a variable named `PUBLICIP`:

    Azure CLI

    ```
    PUBLICIP="$(az vm list-ip-addresses\
        --resource-group "myResourceGroupName"\
        --name public\
        --query "[].virtualMachine.network.publicIpAddresses[*].ipAddress"\
        --output tsv)"

    echo $PUBLICIP
    ```

8.  Run the following command to save the public IP address of the **private** VM to a variable named `PRIVATEIP`:

    Azure CLI

    ```
    PRIVATEIP="$(az vm list-ip-addresses\
        --resource-group "myResourceGroupName"\
        --name private\
        --query "[].virtualMachine.network.publicIpAddresses[*].ipAddress"\
        --output tsv)"

    echo $PRIVATEIP
    ```

Test traffic routing through the network virtual appliance
----------------------------------------------------------

The final steps use the Linux `traceroute` utility to show how traffic is routed. You'll use the `ssh` command to run `traceroute` on each VM. The first test shows the route taken by ICMP packets sent from the **public** VM to the **private** VM. The second test shows the route taken by ICMP packets sent from the **private** VM to the **public** VM.

1.  Run the following command to trace the route from **public** to **private**. When prompted, enter the password for the **azureuser** account that you specified earlier.

    Bash

    ```
    ssh -t -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no azureuser@$PUBLICIP 'traceroute private --type=icmp; exit'
    ```

    If you receive the error message `bash: traceroute: command not found`, wait a minute and retry the command. The automated installation of `traceroute` can take a minute or two after VM deployment. After the command succeeds, the output should look similar to the following example:

    Text

    ```
    traceroute to private.kzffavtrkpeulburui2lgywxwg.gx.internal.cloudapp.net (10.0.1.4), 64 hops max
    1   10.0.2.4  0.710ms  0.410ms  0.536ms
    2   10.0.1.4  0.966ms  0.981ms  1.268ms
    Connection to 52.165.151.216 closed.
    ```

    Notice that the first hop is to 10.0.2.4. This address is the private IP address of **nva**. The second hop is to 10.0.1.4, the address of **private**. In the first exercise, you added this route to the route table and linked the table to the **publicsubnet** subnet. So now all traffic from **public** to **private** is routed through the NVA.

    ![Diagram of route from public to private.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/control-network-traffic-flow-with-routes/media/6-public-private-route.svg)

2.  Run the following command to trace the route from **private** to **public**. When prompted, enter the password for the **azureuser** account.

    Bash

    ```
    ssh -t -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no azureuser@$PRIVATEIP 'traceroute public --type=icmp; exit'
    ```

    You should see the traffic go directly to **public** (10.0.0.4) and not through the NVA, as shown in the following command output.

    Text

    ```
    traceroute to public.kzffavtrkpeulburui2lgywxwg.gx.internal.cloudapp.net (10.0.0.4), 64 hops max
    1   10.0.0.4  1.095ms  1.610ms  0.812ms
    Connection to 52.173.21.188 closed.
    ```

    The **private** VM is using default routes, and traffic is routed directly between the subnets.

    ![Diagram of route from private to public.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/control-network-traffic-flow-with-routes/media/6-private-public-route.svg)

You've now configured routing between subnets to direct traffic from the public internet through the **dmzsubnet** subnet before it reaches the private subnet. In the **dmzsubnet** subnet, you added a VM that acts as an NVA. You can configure this NVA to detect potentially malicious requests and block them before they reach their intended targets.
