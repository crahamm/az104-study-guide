Exercise - Create a VM using the Azure portal
=============================================

You've planned out the network infrastructure and identified a few VMs to migrate to the cloud. You have several choices for creating your VMs. The choice you make depends on the environment you're comfortable with. Azure supports a web-based portal for creating and administering resources. You can also choose to use command-line tools that run on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

> **Note:** This exercise is optional. If you want to complete this exercise, you'll need to create an Azure subscription before you begin. If you don't have an Azure account or you don't want to create one at this time, you can read through the instructions so you understand the information that's being presented.

> **Note:** You need to use a resource group to complete the steps in this exercise. You can use a resource group that you already created, or you can create a new resource group specifically for this exercise. If you choose to create a new resource group, that will make it easier to clean up any resources that you create as you complete the exercise. If you don't have an existing resource group or you want to create a new one specifically for this exercise, you can follow the steps in [Use the Azure portal and Azure Resource Manager to manage resource groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal) to create a resource group by using the Azure portal, or you can follow the steps in [Manage Azure resource groups by using Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-cli) to create a resource group by using the the Azure CLI.

> **Note:** Throughout this exercise, replace **myResourceGroupName** in the examples with the name of an existing resource group, or the name of the resource group that you created for this exercise.

#### Options to create and manage VMs

Let's explore the Azure portal first - it's the easiest way to start with Azure.

Azure portal
------------

The **Azure portal** provides an easy-to-use browser-based user interface that enables you to create and manage all your Azure resources. For example, you can set up a new database, increase the compute power of your virtual machines, and monitor your monthly costs. It's also a great learning tool, because you can survey all available resources and use guided wizards to create the ones you need.

### Create an Azure VM with the Azure portal

Let's assume you want to create a VM running a web server on Ubuntu. Setting up a site isn't difficult, but there are a couple of things to keep in mind. You need to install and configure an operating system, configure a website, install a database, and worry about things like firewalls. We're going to cover creating VMs in the next few modules, but let's create one here to see how easy it is. We don't go through all the options - check out one of the **Create a VM** modules to get complete details on each option.

1.  Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2.  On the Azure home page, under **Azure services**, select **Create a resource**. The **Create a resource** pane appears, displaying popular products for Azure services.

3.  We want to create a VM, so select **Virtual machine**.

4.  The **Create virtual machine** pane appears.

### Configure the VM

You need to configure the basic parameters of your virtual machine. If some of the options at this point are unfamiliar to you, that's OK. We're going to describe all of these options in a future module. You're welcome to copy the values used here.

1.  On the **Basics** tab, enter the following values for each setting.

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- |  --- |
    | **Project details** |  |
    | --- |  --- |
    | Subscription | Select your subscription |
    | Resource group | Select **myResourceGroupName** from the drop-down |
    | **Instance details** |  |
    | Virtual machine name | Enter *test-ubuntu-cus-vm* |
    | Region | From the dropdown list, select a geographical location close to you. |
    | Availability options | No infrastructure redundancy required |
    | Security type | Standard |
    | Image | Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS - Gen2 |
    | VM architecture | x64 |
    | Run with Azure Spot discount | Unchecked |
    | Size | Standard D2s V3 |
    | **Administrator account** |  |
    | Authentication type | SSH public key |
    | Username | Enter a username |
    | SSH public key source | Generate a new key pair |
    | Key pair name | **test-ubuntu-cus-vm\_key** |
    | **Inbound port rules** |  |
    | Public inbound ports | Allow selected ports |
    | Select inbound ports | SSH (22) |

2.  There are several other tabs you can explore to see the settings you can influence during the VM creation. After you're finished exploring, select **Review + create** to review and validate the settings.

3.  Azure validates your configuration settings for a resource before it creates it. You might need to supply some additional information based on the requirements of the image creator built into Azure. It's simple; just open the tab that has an error. Verify all the settings are set the way you want, and then select **Create** to deploy and create the VM.

4.  The **Generate new key pair** window opens. Select **Download private key and create resource**.

5.  You can monitor the deployment in the **Deployment details** on the **Overview** pane or through the **Notifications**pane. Select the notifications icon in the top right toolbar to show or hide the Notifications pane.

    ![Screenshot showing the notifications icon on toolbar and part of the notifications pane.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/intro-to-azure-virtual-machines/media/3-notifications.png)

    The VM deployment process takes a few minutes to complete. You receive a notification informing you that the deployment succeeded.

6.  Select **Go to resource**. The **Overview** page of your VM appears.

    Here, you can see all the information and configuration options for your newly created Ubuntu VM. One of the pieces of information is the **Public IP address**.

    ![Screenshot showing VM essentials and properties with the public IP address highlighted.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/intro-to-azure-virtual-machines/media/3-public-ip-address.png)

    When you enabled SSH public key authentication in an earlier step, the user interface also gave an option to enable SSH. SSH allows you to connect to your VM via the public IP using any SSH client.

Congratulations! With a few steps, you deployed a VM that runs Linux. Let's explore some other ways we could have created a VM.
